This repository contains a seed project for Express server applications written in ES5/ES6. It is part of the [Meanie](https://github.com/meanie/meanie) eco system, which is a collection of boilerplate code and libraries for developing, testing and building javascript applications using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node).

This seed project is built to work together side by side with either the [Angular seed](https://github.com/meanie/angular-seed) (ES5/ES6) or [Angular 2 seed](https://github.com/meanie/angular2-seed) (TypeScript) projects for client side applications.

## Installation
You can install this seed project either by manually cloning the repository, or by using the [Meanie CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meanie), which will make the process a bit easier.

If you don't have the Meanie CLI tool installed, you can get it using:

```shell
npm install -g meanie
```

### Using the Meanie CLI
```shell
# Seed a new Express project in the current directory
meanie seed express

# Seed a new Express project in the specified directory
meanie seed express my-project
```

### Cloning from github
```shell
# Create empty project directory
mkdir my-project
cd my-project

# Clone repository, remove .git folder
git clone https://github.com/meanie/express-seed.git .
rm -rf .git

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Setting the environment
The application environment is determined by the `APP_ENV` environment variable.
This is so you can use different application environments, e.g. `demo`, `staging`, `production`, each with a `NODE_ENV` set to `production`.

## Running the server
Once installed, you can run the server using one of the following options:

```shell
# Start the server
npm start
```

Look in the `package.json` for other scripts available to you.

## Folder structure

The following is an outline of the folder structure of this seed project:

```shell
# This is where your server side Express application resides.
├─ app

# This folder contains your environment specific application config.
├─ config
